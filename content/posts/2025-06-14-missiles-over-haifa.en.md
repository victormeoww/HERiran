**11:47 PM Local Time:** Iranian state media confirms missile launches from Tehran and Isfahan toward Israel.

**11:52 PM:** First footage emerges from Lebanon showing missile trails crossing the night sky, heading south toward Israeli territory.

**12:03 AM:** Reports from Haifa show missiles incoming. Air defense systems engage. Multiple interceptions visible, but not all missiles are stopped.

**12:15 AM:** Footage circulates showing impacts in and around Haifa—notably, not Tel Aviv as many expected. The targeting appears deliberate.

**12:30 AM:** Iranian state television begins broadcast loop of launch footage, framing strikes as "measured response to aggression."

## What They&apos;re Not Saying

The same reports mention that the United States recently redirected counter-drone defense systems from Ukraine to the Middle East. The timing suggests this escalation was anticipated by Western intelligence.

Iranian officials are celebrating on state television, but there&apos;s no discussion of what happens next. No mention of potential retaliation. No acknowledgment of the economic and diplomatic fallout this will bring.

From inside Iran, the mood is more complicated than the broadcasts suggest. In my area, far from Tehran, people are worried. Not celebrating. Worried about sanctions, about food prices, about what this means for our already crumbling economy.

The missiles have stopped flying for now.

But the consequences are just beginning.
