According to official statements and footage verified across multiple sources, last night&apos;s missile strikes originated from two Iranian cities:

**Tehran:** The capital, home to major military installations and the center of Iran&apos;s missile program.

**Isfahan:** A strategic city in central Iran, known for housing nuclear facilities and weapons production sites.

The choice of launch sites is deliberate. These aren&apos;t remote military bases—these are major population centers. The regime wanted visibility. They wanted the launches to be seen, filmed, broadcast.

## What This Means

Using urban launch sites sends a message: Iran is willing to conduct military operations from within its civilian areas, potentially using population density as a shield against retaliation.

It also means anyone living near these facilities—including millions of ordinary Iranians in Tehran and Isfahan—becomes collateral in decisions they never made.

## The Targeting

Initial reports focused on Haifa rather than Tel Aviv. This suggests a strategic calculation: hitting northern Israel&apos;s port city and industrial center rather than the political capital. Whether this represents restraint or specific military targeting remains unclear.

## What Happens Next

As of this morning, Israeli officials have not yet announced their response, but history suggests retaliation is certain. The question is not if, but when and how severe.

Meanwhile, inside Iran, we wait. Not for missiles—those already flew. We wait for the economic consequences, the diplomatic fallout, the tightening sanctions, the currency collapse, the price increases.

We wait for all the ways this decision will echo through our lives in the weeks and months ahead.

The missiles took minutes to reach their targets.

We&apos;ll be dealing with the aftermath for years.
